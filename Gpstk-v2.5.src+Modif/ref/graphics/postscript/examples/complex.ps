% Postscript program to draw some curves & text
% comments in Postscript proceed from '%' to end of line

% part 1: set up coordinate system
72 72 scale	% scale coordinate system so units are inches, not points
2 2 translate	% put origin 2 inches from lower left of page
% warning: if you leave off the above two lines, your picture will be tiny!

% part 2: draw a filled path

% counterclockwise path on the outside consisting of two Bezier segments
0 0 moveto
2.5 0   2 2  1 3 curveto
0 4  -1 0  0 0 curveto

% clockwise path on the inside consisting of one Bezier and two line segs
% this makes a "hole"
1 1 moveto	% because this is moveto and not lineto, "pen" is lifted
1 2 lineto
2 3   3 2  2 1 curveto
closepath

fill		% fill inbetween the outer & inner curves


% part 3: for reference, draw the control polygons for the curves used above.
% note that this is the same sequence of (x,y) points as above

.5 setgray
.03 setlinewidth	% set line width to .03 of current units (inches)

0 0 moveto
2.5 0 lineto  2 2 lineto  1 3 lineto
0 4 lineto -1 0 lineto  0 0 lineto

1 1 moveto
1 2 lineto
2 3 lineto   3 2 lineto  2 1 lineto
closepath
stroke % draw control polygon

% part 4: now we'll put up some text to label coordinates of a few points
/Helvetica findfont 12 72 div scalefont setfont
% 12 point Helvetica (we divide by 72 above because we scaled earlier)
1 setgray % white
0 0 moveto ((0,0)) show
0 setgray % black
1 1 moveto ((1,1)) show
1 3 moveto ((1,3)) show

1 -1 moveto (cubic Bezier curves in Postscript!) show
